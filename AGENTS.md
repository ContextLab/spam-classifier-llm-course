# SPAM Classifier Assignment Repository

**Parent:** [llm-course](https://github.com/ContextLab/llm-course) (see main AGENTS.md)

## Overview

Assignment 2 template repository for PSYC 51.17. Students build a text classification system to identify spam messages.

## Structure

```
spam-classifier-llm-course/
├── Assignment2_SPAM_Classifier.ipynb  # Template notebook (has Colab badge)
├── training.zip                       # Training dataset
├── README.md                          # Assignment description
└── AGENTS.md                          # This file
```

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Assignment2_SPAM_Classifier.ipynb` | Student-facing notebook with Colab badge |
| `training.zip` | SMS spam dataset for training/evaluation |

## Conventions

- Notebook opens in Colab via badge at top
- Students fork via GitHub Classroom, not direct clone
- Dataset extracted in notebook, not pre-extracted

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't commit solution code to this repo (template only)
- Don't include test set (held back for autograding)
